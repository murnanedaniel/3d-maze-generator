# 3d-maze-generator

This is a parametric model for a 3D maze.  Generates openscad which can render
to STL.  It uses Prim's algorithm to generate the maze so it has a defined
start.

The maze is generated randomly but the start is always on the same face.
Parameters like size, diameter, and number of nodes can be supplied.  The end is 
chosen by choosing the node on an outside edge that is furthest from the start.

## Heads-up:

This is a forked version of the original 3d-maze-generator library. It is updated Python3, and a couple of bugs are fixed that allow it to run smoothly. However, I can't vouch that the output is as expected. It **does** produce valid .scad files, but they may not match those produced by the Python2 version.

## Installation

Install my version of Solid Python.  The official version currently has a couple bugs.

```
git clone https://github.com/conorpp/SolidPython
cd SolidPython
sudo python setup.py install
```

Install other pip modules

```
pip install docopt
```

## Usage

```
3D maze generator.  Uses Prim's alg to generator maze with
a start and an end and no loops.  Outputs openscad.

Usage:
  maze.py -h
  maze.py [-x WIDTH] [-y HEIGHT] [-z DEPTH] [-r RES] [-n SPACING] [-d DIAMETER] [-m | -s] <output.scad>
Options:
  -h, --help                    Show this help message and exit
  -x --width WIDTH              Number of cells wide [default: 5]
  -y --height HEIGHT            Number of cells high [default: 5]
  -z --depth DEPTH              Number of cells deep [default: 5]
  -r --resolution RES           Resolution of rendering [default: 25]
  -n --node-spacing SPACING     Distance between nodes in mm [default: 8.0]
  -d --diameter DIAMETER        Diameter of nodes in mm [default: 6.0]
  -m --enable-mesh              Creates a cross hatch mesh and subtracts maze from it.
  -s --enable-solid             Creates a solid cube and subtracts maze from it.

Examples:
python maze.py output.scad
python maze.py [-x 10] [-y 5] [-z 4]  [-n 10] [-d 3] [-m | -s] <output.scad>
```

Running the maze.py program will generate an openscad file.  Open this with an openscad version
built after 2017.  You can find these versions right now by going to the [downloads](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) page
and going to **Development Snapshots**.
